# InverseUQ_AdvDiff
Bayesian inference on an advection-diffusion system to quantify the uncertainty in input parameters

MCMC_MH_DRAM_*.py files uses DRAM MCMC method to estimate posterior of stochastic variables
VB_main_stoch_*.py files uses variational bayes method to estimate posterior of stochastic variables
AdvDiff_solver.py solves for advection diffusion pde problem with given source, diffusivity, advection terms
and boundary conditions (as arguments)
